 **Goal**: Learn how to use movement commands with specific durations.
 
 By default, each command sent to MyMiniRaceCar will last for a predetermined duration. You can issue commands with specific durations by including a numeric value in milliseconds between the commands left and right parentheses. For example: the command `moveForward(1000)` will make MyMiniRaceCar move forward for one second, `wait(300)` will cause the car to pause for three hundred milliseconds.
 
 **Instructions:** Enter 3 or more commands with durations and then press the **Run My Code** button.
