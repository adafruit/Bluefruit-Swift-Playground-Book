# Bluefruit-Swift-Playground-Book
Control your Bluefruit LE board via iPad through your Swift Playground book!

Ever thought about creating a Swift playground book? If so, this is the learn guide for you! In the process of creating a Swift Playground book for use with Adafruit's Bluefruit devices, I noticed that there's very little public information available on the subject. Hopefully this guide will help share what I've learned with the world.

In this learn guide we will:

• Give you a playground book template to get you started on project.

• Show you how to get started authoring your own playground book with bluetooth capabilities.

• Explain to you how a Playground book is structured.
